# Cyber Security Homelab
A basic Cyber security homelab where I setup an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help you detect them in the future
